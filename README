This is an implementation of the Java programming language. It is not
intended to be an implementation of the Java virtual machine, however,
so it will not be interoperable with existing JavaVM bytecode.

The parser is heavily influenced by an ANTLR grammar for Java 1.5.

From those roots, though, it's been modified to be more tightly
coupled with Parrot and has been enhanced to support more syntax from
the Java Language Specification, 3rd edition to parse a wider variety
of Java sources (i.e. Java 1.6 and beyond).
